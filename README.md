Theog og:locale says its value should be "The locale these tags are marked up in. Of the format language_TERRITORY. Default is en_US.". But how do I know which identifier use for a language and which identifier use for a territory. Must they have all two words? I think that this specification should mention [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) as a reference or something similar. Otherwise, it's' impossible to know which values are correct/valid/expected.
